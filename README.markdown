# Puppet Docs


Curated documentation for Puppet.

## Where is everything?

This repo has been split into two distinct branches of documentation, archived and current. The master branch contains only documentation that is presently being generated into HTML and delivered to our new drupal integration. The archive branch contains older versions of documentation that are to be migrated to a new archive site.


Errors and omissions
--------------------

If something in the documentation doesn't seem right -- or if you
think something important is missing, please [submit a ticket][1] to
[the "DOCUMENT" project][1] (not to Puppet itself).
