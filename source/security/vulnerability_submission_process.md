The following page details the Puppet vulnerability submission process.

## Security Policy

Puppet supports [coordinated disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29#Coordinated_disclosure) of security vulnerabilities. Please note that we have a processes for [reporting security issues with our product line](#product-security) and a process for [reporting security issues with our infrastructure](#infrastructure-security).

## Infrastructure Security

You can report issues for the following Puppet infrastructure:

- puppet.com
- puppetconf.com
- docs.puppet.com
- tickets.puppet.com
- ask.puppet.com
- yum/apt.puppet.com
- and any of our other web properties other than the Forge

While we believe in crediting security researchers who make valuable contributions to our product security, we do not typically provide credit for reporting minor infrastructure security issues on our web properties.

We do not need to receive reports on the following types of issues:

- Software version/banner disclosures
- Directory traversal on yum/apt/downloads.puppet.com where traversal is explicitly desired
- Self-XSS/CSRF on unauthenticated web forms (including logout CSRF)
- Disclosure/discovery of known public files or directories (for example, robots.txt, simple DNS enumeration)
- Brute force attempts (for example, Login page/forgot password without lockouts)
- Account enumeration (for example, enumerating Login/Reset fields for valid accounts without lockouts)

To contact the Puppet infrastructure team, please use the following email address: [security-infrastructure@puppet.com](security-infrastructure@puppet.com).

## Product Security

Please report issues with any Puppet products, including, but not limited to, Puppet Enterprise, Puppet, MCollective, and the Puppet Forge. In addition we ask that you report any security issues related to packages we distribute. However, for issues related to the infrastructure hosting those packages (yum/apt.puppet.com, etc.), please contact the Puppet infrastructure team.

You can contact the Puppet security team via encrypted communication using our GPG Public Key:

Key Fingerprint: 489C F9E6 BB24 2589 EFF5 BB68 8728 524F E21D 3FC6
```

The [key](https://puppetlabs.com/security/gpgkey) is available in ASCII encoded format. You can also retrieve it and verify it from the [MIT Key Server](https://pgp.mit.edu/).

Puppet is happy to fully disclose all details of a security vulnerability, but, in the interest of coordinated disclosure, we do ask security researchers and other stakeholders to allow us sufficient time to patch the vulnerability before publishing the details.

We credit security researchers based on the value of the contributions they provide. The Puppet security team reviews each disclosure and assigns a scored value based on the relevance of the disclosure. These scores are calculated quarterly, and the top individuals are publicly credited on our website. Additional credit will be awarded to those reports who provide code fixes or additional information about how to fix the vulnerability.
