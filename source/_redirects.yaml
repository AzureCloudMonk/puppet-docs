  was: install_system_requirements.html   # Paths are always relative to the "base URL" of the document. So this refers to "https://docs.puppet.com/pe/<VERSION>/install_system_requirements.html".
  became:
    - sys_req_hw.html   # You can use a list of pages in "was" and/or "became". Put the most important/relevant one FIRST, since that's where you land if you use the version switcher.
