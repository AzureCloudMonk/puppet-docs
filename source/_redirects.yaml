# Full documentation at https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/DOCS/Redirecting+pages. But basically, just follow the examples below.
# Put a comment before each group of redirects. Like this:
# The system requirements page was split out into four pages in 2016.4. (DOC-2891)
- in_doc: pe    # One of our 5-or-so canonical "document IDs," as used in _config.yml. "pe", "puppet", "puppetdb", etc.
  was: install_system_requirements.html   # Paths are always relative to the "base URL" of the document. So this refers to "https://docs.puppet.com/pe/<VERSION>/install_system_requirements.html".
  became:
    - sys_req_hw.html   # You can use a list of pages in "was" and/or "became". Put the most important/relevant one FIRST, since that's where you land if you use the version switcher.
    - sys_req_os.html
    - sys_req_browsers.html
    - sys_req_sysconfig.html
