Preparing your Puppet code for an upgrade from Puppet 3 to Puppet 4 involves checking the code with the new parser to see if it breaks, and iteratively testing your changes to confirm they do what you want. You can do this any number of ways, but here's a step-by-step workflow for accomplishing the updates using Git and modules specifically built for this task, `catalog_preview` and `preview_report`.

The `catalog_preview` module shows the differences between how your code is compiled in Puppet 3 and Puppet 4, and the `preview_report` module presents the data in an easier to read format.

## Prerequisites

This workflow assumes you are currently running at least Puppet Enterprise 3.8, have complete access to your Puppet code base, and have the ability to create branches and deploy them as environments to a Puppet master on which you will run your tests. You can also use this workflow if you are upgrading an open source Puppet 3.8 installation.

## Preparation

1. Create your working branch

   Start by creating a branch from the `production` branch in your control repository. Name the new branch `future_production`. This will be the branch in which you will do most of your work.

```
git checkout production
git checkout -b future_production
```

2. Enable the future parser

   In this new branch, turn the future parser on by adding `parser=future` to [`environment.conf`](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3.8/reference/config_file_environment.html). Create this file if it does not already exist.

```
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
echo "parser=future" >> environment.conf
git add environment.conf
git commit -m "Enable the Puppet 4 parser in future_production"
```

3. Set up a 3.8 master

   You need a PE 3.8 master as it uses a version of Puppet (3.8.x) that can run with the Puppet 3 or 4 parser.

   A quick way to create the Puppet master is to use the [Puppet Debugging Kit and spin up its 3.8.5 master](https://github.com/Sharpie/puppet-debugging-kit/blob/83871b9afffa4ca14f011bfd4c2489725eb1bb31/config/vms.yaml.example#L31-L40) in Vagrant on your laptop:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sharpie/puppet-debugging-kit.git
   cd puppet-debugging-kit
   cp config/vms.example.yaml config/vms.yaml
   vagrant plugin install oscar
   vagrant up pe-385-master
   vagrant ssh pe-385-master
   ```

   Alternatively, if you have the capacity, create a VM or physical server on your network, with access to your code base.

   If you're using r10k, set up this master to be able to synchronize code from your control repo, using the [zack/r10k](https://forge.puppet.com/zack/r10k) module. You'll also need to [create and authorize SSH keys](https://forge.puppet.com/zack/r10k#setup-requirements) for this new 3.8 master.

### Set up the comparison tools

Set up the [catalog preview](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/catalog_preview) module and the [preview report](https://github.com/puppetlabs/prosvc-preview_report) module on the master you just created.

#### 1. Install the catalog preview module

Install the catalog preview module in the global modulepath:

```
[root@pe-385-master ~]# puppet module install puppetlabs-catalog_preview --modulepath /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/
Notice: Preparing to install into /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules ...
Notice: Downloading from https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules
└── puppetlabs-catalog_preview (v2.1.0)
```

#### 2. Get a list of all active nodes

The catalog preview module takes as input a list of nodes to compile a catalog for. 

Create a list of nodes that is a representative cross-section of all the nodes, and includes as many of the roles and profiles without too much duplication. This shortened list gives you a smaller number of catalogs to compare thus taking less time and getting you feedback on your code updates faster.

You can generate your list of currently active nodes a couple of different ways:

##### Use a PuppetDB query

On the production Puppet master, install PuppetDB Query. Version 1.6.1 is the latest to support PuppetDB 2.x. Then query the nodes to generate a the list in a text file:

```
puppet module install dalen-puppetdbquery --version 1.6.1 --modulepath /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/
puppet plugin download
puppet query nodes "(is_pe=true or is_pe=false)" > nodes.txt
```

##### Use the YAML cache

If PuppetDB isn't available, you can scrape the YAML cache and collect the results together.

`ls -1 $(puppet config print yamldir)/node | awk -F\. 'sub(FS $NF,x)' > nodes.txt`

Clean this list of nodes that are inactive. Alternatively, use a script that looks at the timestamp of the YAML files and filters based on last write date.

For example, the following script finds all YAML files that were accessed in the last hour:

`find $(puppet config print yamldir)/node -maxdepth 1 -type f -mmin -60`

##### Collect node data by using YAML facts

The catalog preview module compiles and inspects catalogs for nodes by simulating a Puppet run against the nodes. This means interacting with PuppetDB where all the data is stored.

It's likely your catalog preview server doesn't have access to PuppetDB data. You can get around this by using the cached facts and node data that are stored as YAML on the real Puppet masters.

First, collect the cached yaml fact files off of the production master.  If there's just one master, copy them over by running a command like this from the diff master:

```
scp -r production-master:/var/opt/lib/pe-puppet/yaml/facts/* \
  /var/opt/lib/pe-puppet/yaml/facts
```

Next, tell the diff master to use the YAML terminus when looking for nodes' facts. If your diff master can still do a puppet agent run against itself, you can just set the puppet_enterprise::profile::master::facts_terminus parameter in the console to "yaml".  It's in the PE Master node group.

Or you can edit the /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/routes.yaml file directly on the diff master, to look something like this:

```
master:
  facts:
    terminus: yaml
    cache: yaml
```

If you change the routes.yaml file by hand, restart pe-puppetserver:

```
systemctl restart pe-puppetserver
```

#### 3. Install the preview report module

Install the preview report module and its requirements onto the PE 3.8 master.

```
[root@pe-385-master ~]# git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/prosvc-preview_report.git
[root@pe-385-master ~]# /opt/puppet/bin/gem install markaby
```

## Generate a baseline report

The first run is to generate a list of issues to solve. 

### Run a catalog preview to get a baseline

```
sudo puppet preview \
  --baseline-environment production \
  --preview-environment future_production \
  --migrate 3.8/4.0 \
  --nodes nodes.txt \
  --view overview-json | tee ~/catalog_preview_overview-baseline.json
```

> **Note:** Save this first report! It acts as the starting metric that you will compare your progress against.

#### Optional: Exclude resources from a catalog preview

The `puppet preview` command can also take an `--excludes <filename.json>` argument. It reads the file supplied as <filename.json> and looks for an array of resources to ignore. You can exclude whole types, types with a particular title, certain attributes of any resource of a given type, and selected attributes of a particular type and title.

For example, the following `example.json` file tells catalog preview to ignore all Augeas resources, all attributes of the `pe-mcollective` service, any File resource's `source` attribute, and the attributes 'activemq_brokers' and 'collectives' for the class `Puppet_enterprise::Mcollective::Server.

````json
[
  {
    "type": "Augeas"
  },
  {
    "type": "Service",
    "title": "pe-mcollective"
  },
  {
    "type": "File",
    "attributes": [ "source" ]
  },
  {
    "type": "Class",
    "title": "Puppet_enterprise::Mcollective::Server",
    "attributes": [
                    "activemq_brokers",
                    "collectives"
                  ]
  }
]
````

>**Note:** Ignoring a particular Class resource ignores only the resource representing the Class, as it appears inside the catalog. It does not (as you might have hoped) exclude all resources declared inside that class. It just ignores the attributes (parameters) of the class itself.

### View the generated report

Taking the overview JSON output from the catalog preview module, pass it through the preview report module to get a nice HTML view of the run. Consider setting up a simple webserver with Apache or Nginx so you can view these reports remotely.

```
cd ~/prosvc-preview_report
sudo ./preview_report.rb -f ~/catalog_preview_overview-baseline.json -w /var/www/catalog_preview/overview-baseline.html
```

> **Note:** Save this first report! It acts as the starting metric which you will compare your progress against.
>
> For maximum awesomeness, automate the catalog preview run and the report processor run in a cron job or via a webhook on your control repository.

## Start fixing issues

Start by fixing the issues that are most common or the ones that affect the most nodes, likely those that cause a catalog compilation error. It is important to solve compilation errors first because there could be issues hiding behind a failed catalog. Think of this process as peeling back an onion. You'll need to go through layer by layer until you get to the delicious oniony center.

### 1. Identify your biggest issue

Start with the issue that is causing the most catalog compilation failures. For example, in Puppet 3, the `=~` operator works if the left item is `undef`, in Puppet 4 it causes a compilation failure.

```puppet
$foo = undef
if $foo =~ 'bar' { do something } # This works in Puppet 3, but not Puppet 4.
```

### 2. Create a branch

Create a branch from `future_production` and name it after the issue being fixed:

```shell
git checkout future_production
git checkout -b issue123_undef_regex_match
```

### 3. Solve the problem

Usually the fixes are simple, such as switching to a different operator or doing a pre-check:

```puppet
if $foo and ($foo =~ 'bar') {
  do something
}
```

Keep the work being done in this branch strictly to the issue at hand. As tempting as it may be to fix style and other issues, leave that for a future iteration. Keep your work atomic and clear.

### 4. Commit your fix

When you think you've found a fix for the issue, commit your work into the `issue123_undef_regex_match` branch.

Make your commit messages very clear and don't be afraid of being too verbose. A decent commit message for this example would be something like:

```
Fix regex operators to support Puppet 4

Prior to this, when using the =~ operator to compare strings in Puppet 3,
if the left operand was undef the operation would succeed with the expected
output. In Puppet 4, if the left operand is undef, a catalog compilation
failure occurs.

https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_expressions.html#regex-or-data-type-match

See this catalog diff for an example of this affecting 70% of our nodes:
http://link.to.catalog.diff.for.issue123.html

This commit fixes the issue by attempting to make sure that the left operand
is never undef, and in cases where that can't be guaranteed, we add additional
logic to first check if the variable to be used has a value.
```

### 5. Test your fix

After committing to your issue branch, deploy it to the diff master and run a new diff report against the `issue123_undef_regex_match` environment and the `production` environment.

It's helpful if you're able to limit your test run to just the nodes or a subset of the nodes that the issue was affecting. This speeds up the feedback loop of whether or not your fix worked.

- **If the issue is solved:**

    Save the catalog diff report to mark your progress.

- **If the issue is not solved:**

    Continue attempting to solve the issue by making additional commits to the `issue123_undef_regex_match` branch and re-deploying and running your tests again.

Repeat this process until the issue is solved.

Once the issue is solved, generate a catalog report that shows the issue is not present.

### 6. Merge your fix

The `future_production` branch is the place where all the finished fixes are stored. So, after you solve an issue on a fix branch, merge it into the `future_production` branch. Use a mixture of squashing, rebasing, and merging to have a clean history from which you can create pull requests when it comes time to incorporate your changes into production.


#### Squash your fix branch into a single commit

If it took you more than one commit to solve the issue, you should squash those multiple commits together so that the fix is packaged as a single atomic patch.

For example, if it took you three commits until you landed on the fix, you can squash those three commits down to one:

```
[control-repo]$ git checkout issue123_undef_regex_match
[control-repo]$ git log --graph --decorate --oneline

* 67b65bf (HEAD -> issue_123_undef_regex_match) third try
* 57f6a66 second try
* 77c176f first try
* 115b3f7 (production, future_production) Initial commit
```

Perform an interactive rebase of the last three commits. Use `fixup` for the commits you want to squash and `reword` on the top commit. This allows you to squash the commits together and rewrite the commit message into a coherent message. If there were valuable comments in any of the commits being squashed, use the `squash` command rather than `fixup` as you'll be able to preserve the message.

```
[control-repo]$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
  reword 77c176f first try
  fixup 57f6a66 second try
  fixup 67b65bf third try

  # Rebase 115b3f7..67b65bf onto 115b3f7 (3 command(s)
  #
  # Commands:
  # p, pick = use commit
  # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
  # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
  # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
  # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
  # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
  # d, drop = remove commit
```

#### Avoid merge commits

Use rebase and merge so that when you merge your fix branch into `future_production` there are no merge commits. There will be no merge commits because your clean Git history will permit a fast-forward.

```
[control-repo]$ git checkout issue123_undef_regex_match
[control-repo]$ git rebase future_production
[control-repo]$ git checkout future_production
[control-repo]$ git merge issue123_undef_regex_match
```

### 7. Repeat for the rest of the issues

Take the next issue in the list and solve it by repeating the process. Create a tracking ticket, create a topic branch, run tests, merge into the `future_production` branch.

## Merge fixes into production

Decide when and how to promote solved issues from the `future_production` to the `production` environment. There are two ways that this could go:

### Cherry-pick individual fixes and make a pull request

It is safer to merge in changes one fix at a time. To do this, create a branch from production and cherry-pick the commit from the issue branch:

```
[control-repo]$ git checkout production
[control-repo]# git pull origin production
[control-repo]$ git checkout -b "solve_issue_123"
[control-repo]$ git cherry-pick issue123_undef_regex_match
# Amend the commit message if necessary
[control-repo]$ git commit --amend
[control-repo]$ git push origin solve_issue_123
# Create a pull request from `solve_issue_123` into `production`
```

This method involves more work because you create a pull request (PR)and additional branches, but this is the cleanest method and the easiest to revert should something go wrong.

### Create a PR from `future_production` into `production`

This method is faster, but there is more opportunity for merge conflicts. If you use this method, it is very important to keep `future_production` up to date with `production` by frequently rebasing (maybe at the start of each day):

```
[control-repo]$ git checkout future_production
[control-repo]$ git fetch --all
[control-repo]$ git rebase origin/production
```

From this point, you can push `future_production` to `origin` and create a PR that merges the entire branch into `production`.

```
[control-repo]$ git checkout future_production
[control-repo]$ git push origin future_production
# Create a pull request from `future_production` into `production`
```

## Example issues and their fixes

The catalog preview module maintains [a list of common breaking changes](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-catalog_preview#migration-warnings) that you should be aware of when moving from Puppet 3 to Puppet 4.

You should also run through the checklist on [updating 3.x manifests for 4.x](./updating_manifests.html).

Here are some real-world examples of common types of issues you may encounter, and examples for how to fix them.

### Example: Unquoted file modes (`MIGRATE4_AMBIGUOUS_NUMBER`)

File modes need to go in quotes in Puppet 4. If you do a `puppet-lint` run with the `--fix` option, it automatically updates these for you.

### Example: File "source" of a single-item array

You can give the File resource an array for "source" and it uses whichever one it finds first. Sites that use this trick extensively will sometimes just always use an array, even if it's a single-item array. The migration tools kick out a warning that can be ignored. (Use the `--excludes` option detailed above.)

````puppet
file { '/etc/flarghies.conf':
  ensure => file,
  source => [ 'puppet:///modules/smoorghies/flarghies.conf' ],
}
````

### Example: Regular expressions against numbers

Sometimes, code does a regular expression match against a number, for instance, to see if the OS release begins with a particular digit, or a package is of at least some version. Trying to do a match against a number breaks in Puppet 4.

A regular expression against numbers makes catalog compilation fail entirely.

Switch to using Puppet's built-in `versioncmp` function, which is also more flexible than a regular expression. For OS checks, try a more specific fact, such as `$operatingsystemmajrelease`, which shows the first digit.

### Example: Empty strings are not false (`MIGRATE4_EMPTY_STRING_TRUE`)

Empty strings used to evaluate to false, and now they don't. If you can't change what's returning the empty string to return a real Boolean, wrap the string in `str2bool()` from `puppetlabs-stdlib` and it'll return false on an empty string.

### Example: Variables must start with lower case letter

Puppet 4 thinks a capital letter refers to a constant. Lowercase your variables.

Uppercased variable names make catalog compilation fail entirely.

### Example: Ineffectual conditional cases

A conditional that does nothing is no longer allowed, unless it's the last case in a case statement. Ineffectual conditionals creep into code when someone has commented out things in a conditional while debugging.

Note that declaring an anchor resource counts as a conditional having an effect -- so at least you can declare an anchor inside the conditional block so that it "does something" but nothing of consequence.

````puppet
if ( $starfish == 'marine' ) {
  notify { 'You are a star fish.': }
}
elsif ( $cucumber == 'sea' ) {
  # DEBUG commenting out for now.
  # file { '/etc/invertebrate':
  #   ensure => file,
  #   content => 'true',
  #  }
}
else {
  service { 'refrigerator':
    ensure => running,
  }
}
````

### Example: Class names can't have hyphens

In Puppet 2.7, the acceptability of hyphenated class names changed a few times. The root problem is that hyphens are not distinguishable from arithmetic subtraction operations in Puppet's syntax. In Puppet 3, class names with hyphens were deprecated but not completely removed. In Puppet 4, they are completely illegal because arithmetical expressions can appear in more places.

A class name with a hyphen makes catalog compilation fail entirely.

### Example: Import no longer works

Sometimes, an old-school `site.pp` file would do something like `import nodes/*.pp`. You don't fix this in code, but instead use the `manifestdir` setting in `puppet.conf` to import a whole directory and all subdirectories.

An import statement makes catalog compilation fail entirely.
