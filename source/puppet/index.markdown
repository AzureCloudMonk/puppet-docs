This is the documentation for Puppet, as well as several related tools and applications.

Most of the content here applies equally to Puppet Enterprise and open source releases of Puppet, but make sure you're using the right docs version for your Puppet Enterprise version. If you get lost, check the version note in red text at the top of each page.

## Main docs


Practically speaking, Puppet is a collection of several projects. Here's the documentation for all of the major components that make up a Puppet deployment:

Component     | Latest                                     | Other versions

## Puppet reference manuals

A concise reference to Puppet's usage and internals. Use the left sidebar of any reference manual page to navigate between pages.

<ul>
{% assign this_doc = "puppet" %}

{% assign real_name = site.document_names[this_doc] %}
{% for base_url in site.document_version_order[this_doc] %}
{% if site.document_version_index[this_doc].latest == base_url %}{% assign past_latest = true %}{% endif %}
<li>
<a href="{{base_url}}">{{real_name}} {{site.document_list[base_url].version}}</a>
{% unless past_latest %}(not yet released){% endunless %}
{% if site.document_version_index[this_doc].latest == base_url %}(latest){% endif %}
{% if site.document_list[base_url].my_versions.pe != "latest" %}(Included in Puppet Enterprise {{site.document_list[base_url].my_versions.pe}}){% endif %}
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

> **Note:** The "Puppet 3" manual covers versions 3.0 through 3.4.
