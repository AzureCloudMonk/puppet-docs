This is the documentation for Puppet, as well as several related tools and applications.

Most of the content here applies equally to Puppet Enterprise and open source releases of Puppet, but make sure you're using the right docs version for your Puppet Enterprise version. If you get lost, check the version note in red text at the top of each page.

Main Docs
