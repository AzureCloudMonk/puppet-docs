## Hardware

The Puppet agent service has no particular hardware requirements and can run on nearly anything.

However, the Puppet master service is fairly resource intensive, and should be installed on a robust dedicated server.

* At a minimum, your Puppet master server should have two processor cores and at least 1 GB of RAM.
* To comfortably serve at least 1,000 nodes, it should have 2-4 processor cores and at least 4 GB of RAM.

The demands on the Puppet master vary widely between deployments. The total needs are affected by the number of agents being served, how frequently those agents check in, how many resources are being managed on each agent, and the complexity of the manifests and modules in use.

## Platforms with packages

Puppet and all of its prerequisites run on the following platforms, and Puppet provides official packages in [Puppet Collections](./puppet_collections.html).

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and derivatives)

We publish and test official [`puppet-agent`](/puppet/latest/reference/about_agent.html) packages for the following versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL):

This information applies to RHEL itself, as well as any distributions that maintain binary compatibility with it, including but not limited to CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Oracle Linux.

### SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

We publish and test official `puppet-agent` packages for the following versions of Debian:

-   Debian 8 "Jessie" (current stable release)
-   Debian 7 "Wheezy" (previous stable release)

We also publish and test official `puppet-agent` packages for the following versions of Ubuntu:

-   Ubuntu 16.04 LTS "Xenial Xerus"
-   Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trusty Tahr"
-   Ubuntu 12.04 LTS "Precise Pangolin"

* Windows Server 2016 
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2008 R2

* Windows Vista (**Note:** Service Pack 2 end of life date is April 11,2017)

### macOS

We publish and test official [`puppet-agent`](/puppet/latest/reference/about_agent.html) packages for the following macOS versions:

* 10.12 Sierra
* 10.11 El Capitan
* 10.10 Yosemite

## Platforms without packages

Puppet and its prerequisites are known to run on the following platforms, but we do not provide official open source packages or perform automated testing. For platforms supported in Puppet Enterprise, see its [System Requirements]({{pe}}/sys_req_os.html).

### Other Linux

* Gentoo Linux
* Mandriva Corporate Server 4
* Arch Linux

### Other Unix

* Oracle Solaris, version 10 and higher (Puppet performs limited automated testing on Solaris 11)
* AIX, version 5.3 and higher
* FreeBSD 4.7 and later
* OpenBSD 4.1 and later
* HP-UX

## Basic requirements

If you're installing Puppet via the official packages, you won't need to worry about these prerequisites; your system's package manager handles all of them. These are only listed for those running Puppet from source or on unsupported systems.

Puppet has the following prerequisites:

### Ruby

Use one of the following versions of MRI (standard) Ruby:

* 2.1.x


> **Note:** We currently only test and package with 2.1.x versions of Ruby, therefore we recommend you only use this version. Other interpreters and versions of Ruby are not covered by our tests.

### Mandatory libraries

* [Facter](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/) 2.4.3 or later
* [Hiera]({{hiera}}/) 2.0.0 or later
* The `json` gem (any modern version).
* The [`rgen` gem](http://ruby-gen.org/downloads) version 0.6.6 or later is now required because Puppet [`parser = future` is enabled by default](./lang_updating_manifests.html).

### Optional libraries

* The `msgpack` gem is required if you are using [msgpack serialization](./experiments_msgpack.html).
