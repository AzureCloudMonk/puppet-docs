title: "About deprecations in this version of Puppet"
---

The 4.x deprecations focused on Puppet's infrastructure, and APIs, many of these have been removed in Puppet 5. 

You should read through the removals in [Puppet 5 release notes](./release_notes.html#removals) to make sure they won't break your setup before upgrading.

Each deprecation page groups similar features together, and each feature explains what to do if you're affected.
