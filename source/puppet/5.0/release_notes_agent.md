## Puppet agent 5.0.0

Released June 26, 2017.

This is a major release of Puppet agent, and includes updates to nearly every component.


### Component updates

* **Puppet 5:** Feature improvements for types and providers, UTF-8, and Hiera 5.
* **Ruby 2.4:** Reinstallation of user-installed Puppet agent gems is required after upgrade to Puppet agent 5.0.
	* Due to Ruby API changes between Ruby 2.1 and 2.4, any user-installed Puppet agent gems (Ruby gems installed using Puppet agent's gem binary) require re-installation following upgrade to Puppet agent 5.0.
	* Some gems may also require upgrade to versions that are compatible with Ruby 2.4.
* **Augeas 1.8.0:** This component has been updated from 1.4.0 to resolve issues caused by a segfault.
**Facter 3.7:** Read the [Facter 3.7][] release notes about some small bug fixes in this release.
**MCollective 2.11:** Read the [MCollective 2.11.0][] release notes to see the bug fixes in this verison.
**`pxp-agent` 1.6.0:** `pxp-module-puppet` now returns metrics about resource events when a run finishes. It can also accept `job-id` as an argument and pass it to Puppet.
* **Hiera 3.4:** The component version of Hiera in Puppet agent has been increased to 3.4, but Hiera 5 is fully integrated into Puppet. You should update your configuration to use version 5 of `hiera.yaml`.
