Open source Puppet ships `puppet-agent` packages for a variety of platforms, but some systems have been deprecated since we began shipping them, and we will no longer be providing packages for those systems. 

The [system requirements](./system_requirements.html) lists which platforms we currently publish packages for. Watch this space for upcoming deprecations in Puppet 5.
