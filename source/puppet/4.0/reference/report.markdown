Puppet clients can report back to the server after each transaction.  This
transaction report is sent as a YAML dump of the
`Puppet::Transaction::Report` class and includes every log message that was
generated during the transaction along with as many metrics as Puppet knows how
to collect.  See [Reports and Reporting](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/reporting.html) for more information on how to use reports.

Currently, clients default to not sending in reports; you can enable reporting
by setting the `report` parameter to true.

To use a report, set the `reports` parameter on the server; multiple
reports must be comma-separated.  You can also specify `none` to disable
reports entirely.

Puppet provides multiple report handlers that will process client reports:

http
----
Send reports via HTTP or HTTPS. This report processor submits reports as
POST requests to the address in the `reporturl` setting. The body of each POST
request is the YAML dump of a Puppet::Transaction::Report object, and the
Content-Type is set as `application/x-yaml`.

log
---
Send all received logs to the local log destinations.  Usually
the log destination is syslog.

store
-----
Store the yaml report on disk.  Each host sends its report as a YAML dump
and this just stores the file on disk, in the `reportdir` directory.

These files collect quickly -- one every half hour -- so it is a good idea
to perform some maintenance on them if you use this report (it's the only
default report).
