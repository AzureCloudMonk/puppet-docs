This page lists the changes in Puppet 4.4 and its patch releases.

Puppet's version numbers use the format X.Y.Z, where:

* X must increase for major backwards-incompatible changes
* Y can increase for backwards-compatible new functionality
* Z can increase for bug fixes

## If You're Upgrading from Puppet 3.x
