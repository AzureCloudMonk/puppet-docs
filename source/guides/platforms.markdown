title: Open source Puppet platforms and requirements

[pe-requirements]: /pe/latest/install_system_requirements.html

Puppet tests the [open source Puppet suite](/puppet/) against several operating systems and configurations, and for many of them also packages it into the [`puppet-agent` package](/puppet/latest/reference/about_agent.html).

> **Note:** For [Puppet Enterprise's](/pe/) supported platforms, see its [system requirements][pe-requirements].

For more information about about the most recent Puppet 4 packages and platforms, see the [Puppet Collections documentation](/puppet/latest/reference/puppet_collections.html). To request an official package for a platform not on this list, [contact us](https://puppet.com/contact).

## Ruby versions

Puppet requires an [MRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI) [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) interpreter.
Certain versions of Ruby are tested more thoroughly with Puppet than others, and some versions are not tested at all. Run `ruby --version` to check the version of Ruby on your system.

> Starting with Puppet 4, puppet-agent packages do not rely on the OS's Ruby version, as it bundles its own Ruby environment. You can install puppet-agent alongside any version of Ruby or on systems without Ruby installed.
> Likewise [Puppet Enterprise](/pe/) does not rely on the OS's Ruby version, as it bundles its own Ruby environment. You can install PE alongside any version of Ruby or on systems without Ruby installed.
> ![windows logo](/images/windows-logo-small.jpg) The [Windows installers](http://downloads.puppetlabs.com/windows) provided by Puppet Labs don't rely on the OS's Ruby version, and can be installed alongside any version of Ruby or on systems without Ruby installed.

| Ruby version | Puppet 3.x              | Puppet 4.x                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 2.3.x\*      | No                      | Lightly Tested (4.5 and higher) |
| 2.2.x        | No                      | Lightly Tested                  |
| 2.1.x        | Tested (3.5 and higher) | Tested                          |
| 2.0.x        | Tested (3.2 and higher) | Lightly Tested                  |
| 1.9.3\*\*    | Tested                  | Lightly Tested                  |
| 1.8.7        | Tested                  | No                              |

> \* Ruby 2.3.1+. Ruby 2.3.0 has a bug that causes segmentation faults under certain scenarios with puppet.
> \*\* Ruby 1.9.3-p392 and up only. Unfortunately, Ubuntu Precise ships with 1.9.3-p0. If you're using Precise with Puppet 3.x, we recommend using Puppet Enterprise or installing a third-party Ruby package.

Versions marked as "Tested" are recommended by Puppet and are under automated test coverage. As of Puppet 4, where `puppet-agent` packages bundle Ruby, versions marked "Lightly Tested" are under reduced automated test coverage (specifically, spec tests only) -- the Ruby version bundled with `puppet-agent` is the recommended version. We do not recommend other versions or make any guarantees about their performance with Puppet.

## Prerequisites

Puppet has a very small number of external dependencies:

| Dependency | Puppet 3.x | Puppet 4.x |
|------------|------------|------------|
| [Facter][] | Required   | Required   |
| [Hiera][]  | Required   | Required   |
| [rgen][]   | Optional   | Required   |

Rgen is only needed if you are using Puppet 4 (or Puppet â‰¥ 3.2 [with `parser = future` enabled](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_future.html)). The official Puppet Labs packages will install it as a dependency.

[Facter]: /facter/
[Hiera]: /hiera/latest/installing.html
[rgen]: http://ruby-gen.org/downloads

All other prerequisite Ruby libraries should come with any standard Ruby install.  Should your OS not come with the complete standard library (or you are using a custom Ruby build), these include:

* base64
* cgi
* digest/md5
* etc
* fileutils
* ipaddr
* openssl (>= 0.9.8o if using a 3.x Puppet master or newer)
* strscan
* syslog
* uri
* webrick
* webrick/https
* xmlrpc
