## Hiera 3.3.2

Released June 13, 2017.

This is a minor bug fix version of Hiera that ships with Puppet agent 1.10.2 and does not affect users.

* [Fixed in Hiera 3.3.2](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?jql=fixVersion+%3D+%27HI+3.3.2%27)
* [Introduced in Hiera 3.3.2](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?jql=affectedVersion+%3D+%27HI+3.3.2%27)


## Hiera 3.3.1

Released March 9, 2017. 

This version of Hiera ships with Puppet agent 1.9.3. It is a small bug fix release.

### Bug fixes

Hiera now errors if it is given a 'hiera.yaml' configuration file that uses the version 4 format, because that format is only available in environments and modules. Previously, Hiera silently ignored its content and no keys were given values. Now there is a clear error if a 'hiera.yaml' version 4 configuration file ends up in the wrong place. ([HI-544](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/HI-544))

Hiera did not read data files into cache using UTF-8, which could lead to encoding problems occurring much later. Now the data files (YAML, JSON) are read with UTF-8 encoding. ([HI-519](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/HI-519))

## Hiera 3.3

Released February 1, 2017.

This version of Hiera ships with [Puppet agent 1.9.0][]. Hiera 5, a successor of the experimental Puppet lookup feature is built into Puppet 4.9, and uses the classic Hiera 3.3 codebase. You can learn more about Hiera 5 in the [Puppet 4.9 release notes][].
