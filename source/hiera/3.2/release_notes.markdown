### Bug fixes

* [HI-528](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/HI-528): Hiera 3.2.x does not support Rubies < 1.9.3. The dependencies on 'json' and 'json_pure' has therefore been dropped from hiera's gemspec to make it easier to consume hiera as a gem.

### New default location for hiera.yaml

The default location of hiera.yaml has changed from the `$codedir` to the `$confdir`. Updating via `puppet-agent 1.5.0` packages will not move your existing file, but new installations will place it in this location. You need to manually move the file to `$confdir`.
