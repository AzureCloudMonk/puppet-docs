You got here from a link, bookmark, or search result that points to the now-defunct Puppet Wiki.

## Use the Puppet docs site instead

Current and supported versions of the information that was once kept on the wiki are available on the Puppet documentation site at [docs.puppet.com](https://docs.puppet.com). Use search or the navigation to find what you're looking for.

## Can't find something? Don't panic.
