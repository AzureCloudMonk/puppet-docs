PuppetDB is the fast, scalable, and reliable data warehouse for Puppet. It caches data generated by Puppet, and gives you advanced features at awesome speed with a powerful API.

## Versions

> **Note:** PuppetDB 3.0 and higher are only compatible with Puppet 4.x, and PuppetDB 2.2 and earlier are only compatible with Puppet 3.x. PuppetDB 2.3 is the transitional version that supports both Puppet 4.x and 3.x.

<ul>
{% assign this_doc = "puppetdb" %}

{% assign real_name = site.document_names[this_doc] %}
{% for base_url in site.document_version_order[this_doc] %}
{% if site.document_version_index[this_doc].latest == base_url %}{% assign past_latest = true %}{% endif %}
<li>
<a href="{{base_url}}">{{real_name}} {{site.document_list[base_url].version}}</a>
{% unless past_latest %}(not yet released){% endunless %}
{% if site.document_list[base_url].my_versions.pe != "latest" %}(Included in Puppet Enterprise {{site.document_list[base_url].my_versions.pe}}){% endif %}
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

> **Note:** The special "[master](./master)" docs version isn't tied to a specific version number; instead, it's whatever is currently in the `master` branch in the PuppetDB repository on GitHub. We've included it as a preview for PuppetDB developers and testers.
