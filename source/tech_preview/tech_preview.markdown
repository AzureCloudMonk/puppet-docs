## Tech Preview Scope of Support

[Puppet Enterprise](/pe/) capabilities with the “tech preview” designation provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to evaluate functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These capabilities, however, are not fully supported, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. As Puppet considers making future iterations of tech preview capabilities generally available, we will attempt to resolve any issues that customers experience during their evaluation.

During the development of a tech preview capability, additional components may become available to the public for evaluation. Because tech preview capabilities are still under development, Puppet cannot guarantee the stability of such capabilities. As a result, if you are evaluating tech preview capabilities, you may not be able to seamlessly upgrade to subsequent releases of that capability. While Puppet intends to fully support tech preview capabilities in future releases, we may discover that a capability does not meet the standards for production viability. If this happens, we cannot guarantee that tech preview capabilities will be released in a supported manner. Some tech preview capabilities may only be available for specific operating system platforms and hardware architectures.

Customers who are interested in providing feedback to the Puppet development team on Puppet tech preview capabilities can do so by [submitting a ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) or by visiting the [Puppet GitHub](https://github.com/puppetlabs) where you can join and contribute to related projects.
